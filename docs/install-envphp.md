# GeoJuji, install PHP environment tools


## Installation

To develop PHP project, you will need the following to be installed and set:
- [PHP](http://php.net/)
- [Apache Server](https://httpd.apache.org/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (Should be installed with Homebrew/Chocolatey formulas)
- [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/)

Since each OS has its own way to install the differents compoments, I will not go in detail and let you use Google.
