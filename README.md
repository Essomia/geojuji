# Geojuji

Geojuji is a personal kit to install all front-end tools on macOS for development.

## Concept

Geojuji contains all the basic configurations and dependencies needed to develop JS projects on macOS. The idea is to keep versioned shells and software configuration files. Then, it is possible to remount a user station quickly with a constant configuration between each station.

## Installation

Get a version of this repository on your git account and then clone the repository on your machine before adjusting configurations.

```
git clone  git@github.com:[username]/geojuji.git  ~/geojuji
```
