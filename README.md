# Geojuji

Geojuji is a kit to install all front-end tools and basic PHP environment on MacOS.

## Concept

Geojuji contains all the basic configurations and dependencies needed to develop JS and basic PHP projects.

The idea is to keep versioned shell configuration files and software configurations files. Then, it is possible to remount a user station quickly with a constant configuration between each station.
